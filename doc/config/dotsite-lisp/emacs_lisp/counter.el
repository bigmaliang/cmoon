;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements a function, `counter', that can be invoked to
;; insert series of numbers into text.  You'll probably want to bind that
;; function to a key sequence; I'll use C-c c as an example in this
;; documentation.  Detailed instructions on how to do that key binding, and
;; on everything else, are below, but here's a summary of what that binding
;; will allow.  Every time you type C-c c, counter inserts a number into the
;; buffer, then increments the value it's up to, so the next C-c c inserts
;; the next number.  You can type C-u C-c c to initialize the starting
;; number, the increment, and the format of the insertion (leading or
;; trailing spaces, for example, or other decoration).  C-u 5 C-c c will
;; insert five numbers; that's the fastest way to insert a series of numbers
;; if you want them all together in the text, separated by nothing but the
;; format decoration.  But you can also use C-c c in keyboard macros,
;; allowing you to do things like insert columns of numbers.  There is also a
;; facility to allow you to renumber a possibly-noncontiguous column, such as
;; occurs with numbered paragraphs.

;; To use this package, first you'll need to copy this file to a directory
;; that appears in your load-path.  `load-path' is the name of a variable
;; that contains a list of directories Emacs searches for files to load.
;; To prepend another directory to load-path, put a line like
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "c:/My_Directory") in your .emacs file.

;; Then you'll need to bind the `counter' function.  This code in your .emacs
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cc" 'counter)
;; will do that binding.  Also include this code
;;   (autoload 'counter "counter" nil t)
;; to tell Emacs where to find the `counter' function.  During the Emacs
;; session in which you type those lines into your .emacs file, you can cause
;; each line to be executed when point is after its final ")" by typing
;; C-x C-e there.

;; That's it, counter is installed, and you're ready to experiment with it.
;; It's initialized by default to reasonable values, so for example you can
;; just type C-x b *scratch* to switch to the *scratch* buffer, and type
;; C-u 4 C-c c to insert a series of 4 numbers.  Then C-u 3 C-c c will insert
;; 3 more numbers without resetting the counter; it doesn't get reset until
;; you reinitialize it with C-u C-c c.

;; C-u C-c c prompts for 3 values: the number to start counting from, the
;; amount by which to increment each new number, and the format for
;; insertion.  The first 2 entries are actually evaluated as Lisp code, so
;; although most of the time you'll just use integers, you can also use, for
;; example, Emacs global variables.  The third entry is also evaluated;
;; usually it's a constant string, but since it's evaluated you can store
;; multiple useful formats in variables and refer to them by name.  The
;; string needs to be double-quoted when it's entered literally; this is
;; helpful when you're looking at the default value or the minibuffer
;; history, since useful formats usually have leading or trailing whitespace,
;; and the quotes make that clear.

;; The second entry is usually a constant increment, but actually has more
;; flexibility than that; it's a Lisp form that's evaluated each time it's
;; used, so the amount of the increment can keep changing.  Also, the form is
;; only construed as an increment if it evaluates to a number.  Otherwise,
;; it's assumed to be a function of one argument that is to be applied to the
;; current value of the counter to produce the next value, so entering
;; (lambda (x) (* x 2)) would allow you to insert a series of numbers each of
;; which is double the previous.

;; The third value is a format string that would be suitable as a first
;; argument to the Emacs Lisp function `format'.  If you're not familiar with
;; that but know C++ or Perl, you can probably just wing it, since it's
;; pretty much the same as in those languages.  The default of " %d", for
;; example, inserts a decimal integer preceded by a single space.

;; These values are normally global to Emacs, so if you run `counter' in one
;; buffer, then move to another buffer without reinitializing and run it
;; again, it'll continue counting from where it left off.  However, in any
;; buffer, you can run M-x counter-localize to make all the counter state
;; variables local in that buffer.  Another option is to put the line
;;   (setq counter-local-by-default t)
;; in your .emacs file; the effect will be that all buffers have their own
;; copies of the counter state variables.

;; Note that because of the generality of the formatting and "incrementing"
;; mechanisms you aren't actually limited to numbers at all; those are just
;; the most common things to insert series of.  A format string of "%S" will
;; insert a printed representation of an arbitrary Lisp object, and the
;; "increment" can perform any arbitrary calculation of what's next.

;; That's all you need to know for the simplest use of `counter', which is
;; just inserting series of numbers or other objects.  There are additional
;; features available for solving more complicated problems.

;; If you have a bunch of numbered items, like
;;      1.  foo       2.  bar       3.  baz
;;      4.  woo       5.  hoo       6.  spoo
;; and want to insert another line, "warga blegga pizza", in the middle,
;; so it gets the 4..6 numbering and "woo hoo spoo" becomes 7..9, then it's
;; not enough to be able to *insert* numbers; you need to be able to
;; *replace* them.  Invoking `counter' as C-u - C-c c causes it to search the
;; region (the range of the buffer between point and mark) for a match to the
;; `counter-target' variable, which is a regular expression that defaults to
;; "[0-9]+" (a nonempty digit string).  If it finds a match, it replaces it
;; with its insertion; otherwise, it doesn't do the insertion at all, or the
;; increment.  This is useful in keyboard macros; in the above example, you
;; can code a macro like
;;   M-@         ;; mark-word
;;   C-x C-x     ;; exchange-point-and-mark
;;   C-u         ;; universal-argument
;;   -           ;; [make that a negative argument]
;;   C-c c       ;; counter
;; to mark each word and run C-u - C-c c on it; if the word contains a
;; number, it'll be replaced by whatever number `counter' is up to, but if
;; not, the macro will have no effect except to move to the next word.  Then
;; you can insert the line
;;      0.  warga     0.  blegga    0.  pizza
;; in the middle, reinitialize counter with a format of "%d" (no surrounding
;; whitespace), and run the keyboard macro 18 times to renumber everything.
;; (Of course you want to be able to do that by just leaning on a single key,
;; not trilling on C-x e, so presumably you've bound `call-last-kbd-macro' to
;; a function key, or are using my vi-dot.el package (see my URL above).)

;; The `counter-target' variable isn't modified by C-u C-c c because most
;; users will never read this far in the documentation and won't know what it
;; is.  You can modify it with M-x set-variable.

;; If your formatting needs are too complex for an Emacs regexp, you may need
;; to code your own Lisp function to decide whether `counter' should replace
;; an object (remember it doesn't need to be a number) in the region with the
;; next object in the series `counter' is inserting.  Every time `counter' is
;; about to insert something, it runs counter-pre-insert-hook, a normal
;; hook.  If any hook function sets the variable `counter-skip' to non-nil,
;; then `counter' skips the insertion, just resetting `counter-skip' to nil.
;; (This is the internal mechanism by which the C-u - argument is handled.)
;; For symmetry, there is also a counter-post-insert-hook run after an
;; insertion.  Whenever an insertion is skipped, the incrementation is also
;; skipped, and so is the running of counter-post-insert-hook.

;; The hooks aren't localized by `counter-localize', since when you're
;; dealing with local hooks you need to use optional arguments to `add-hook',
;; of which check the documentation, along with that of `make-local-hook', if
;; you really need it, which you probably don't even if you're localizing the
;; other counter state variables.

;;; Epigraph:

;;      "[...] my sentiments at heart were insular and mediaeval.
;;         This was my conversion to the baroque.  Here under that
;;       high and insolent dome, under those tricky ceilings;
;;       here, as I passed through those arches and broken pediments
;;       to the pillared shade beyond and sat, hour by hour,
;;       before the fountain, probing its shadows, tracing
;;       its lingering echoes, rejoicing in all its clustered feats
;;       of daring and invention, I felt a whole new system of nerves
;;       alive within me, as though the water that spurted and bubbled
;;       among its stones was indeed a life-giving spring."

increment or function can be a number that will be an increment, or a
function of one argument that calculates the next value from the current one,
or any Lisp expression (such as a variable) that evaluates to either of these
things; the format must evaluate to a control string in which
%d means print a number in decimal (%o octal, %x hex, %04x pad with zeroes),
%e means print a number in exponential notation (%15e pad with spaces),
%f means print a number in decimal-point notation (%.2f 2 decimal places),
%g means %e or %f (whichever uses fewer characters),
%c means print a number as a single character,
%s means print a string argument (actually any object, using `princ'),

that region for the first string matching the regexp in `counter-target', and
