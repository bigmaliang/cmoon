;; Date: 07 Dec 1998 11:28:59 +0100

;; This is an implementation of the xedit `all' command for GNU Emacs.
;;
;; It works mostly like `occur' except that changes to the `*All*' buffer
;; are propagated back to the original buffer.
;;
;; The package is inspired by a discussion in `gnu.emacs.help'.  It uses
;; `before-change-functions' and `after-change-functions' to propagate
;; the changes from a separate buffer, instead of `invisible' and
;; 'intangible' text properties in the original buffer as has been
;; proposed on the newsgroup.  I feel using text properties is
;; conceptually cleaner, but this version works.
;;
;; Insert
;;	(autoload 'all "all" nil t)
;; in your `.emacs' file to enable this package.
;;
;; Type `M-x all RET' to try it out.
;;
;; You need GNU Emacs 19.23 or later to use it.
;;
;; Some code have been stolen from `replace.el' in the Emacs 19.25.93
;; distribution.

;;; Comments:

;; Just like occur, except that changes in the *All* buffer is
;; propagated to the original buffer.

;; I also added highlighting of the matches.

;; You can no longer use mouse-2 to find a match in the original file,
;; since the default definition of mouse to is useful.
;; However, `C-c C-c' still works.

;; Line numbers are not listed in the *All* buffer.

;; Ok, it is _not_ just like occur.

;; Some limitations:

;; - Undo in the *All* buffer is an ordinary change in the original.
;; - Changes to the original buffer is not reflected in the *All* buffer.
;; - A single change in the *All* buffer must be limited to a single match.

;; Requires GNU Emacs 19.23 or later.
