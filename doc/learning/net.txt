Basically, here is what I've tuned on my kernel :

- /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
- /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_max
- /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_*

RECEIVE SOCKET TIMEOUT
The recv call is used to receive messages from a socket, and may be used to receive data on a socket whether or not it is connection-oriented.The recv() function shall return the length of the message written to the buffer pointed to by the buffer argument.
If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not set on the socket’s file descriptor, recv() shall block until a message arrives.
However sometimes application needs its thread to timeout on a socket that blocks when reading. We can set timeout for a blocking rcv ( ) call using setscokopt function call.
setsockopt (connfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, (char *)&tv, sizeof tv);
Here SO_RCVTIMEO allow us to place a timeout on socket receives. Timeout value can be specified in timeval structure, this let us specify the timeout in seconds and microseconds. We can disable timeout by setting its value to 0 seconds and 0 microsecond. Both timeout are disabled by default. The receive timeout affects the five input functions.read, readv,rcv,recvfrom,recvmsg.
RETURN VALUE of rcv ()
Upon successful completion, recv() shall return the length of the message in bytes. If no messages are available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown, recv() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.


C Socket Client-Server Background
=================================
http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/multipage/clientserver.html


send, sendto, sendmsg
----
*RETURN*    the number of charactors sent, on error, -1    send(), sendto(), sendmsg() Locally detected errors are indicated by a return value of -1.

*errno*
EISCONN     sendto() used on a connection-mode socket, and dest_addr, addrlen parameter not null and 0.
ENOTCONN    sendto(), send() used on a connection-mode socket, and socket was not actualy connected.
EMSGSIZE    msg is too long to pass through underlying protocol. and the msg not transmitted.
EWOULDBLOCK    msg does not fit into the send buffer of the socket. sendxxx() normaly blocks, unless the socket has been placed in nonblocking I/O mode. select may be used to 
            determine when it is possible to send more data.

*flags*
MSG_DONTWAIT    enable nonblocking operation. This can also be enabled using the O_NONBLOCK flag with the F_SETFL fnctl()
MSG_MORE(2.6)    the caller has more data to send. same effect as the TCP/UDP_CORK socket option.
                this informs the kernel to package all of the data sent in calls with this flag set into a single datagram which is only transmited 
                when the call is performed that does not specify this flag.
MSG_NOSIGNAL    not to send SIGPIPE on errors on STREAM orinted sockets when the other end breaks the connection. the EPIPE error is still returned.
                on the other hand, recvxxx() return 0 when the other end breaks the connection.
MSG_OOB            send out-of-band (urgent) data



recv
----
EAGAIN      The socket is marked non-blocking and the receive operation would block, or a receive timeout had been set and the  timeout  expired  before
              data was received.
